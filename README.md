#Sobeys App For Students 

IBM/ Sobeys Retail Hackathon 2015:

TEAM MEMBERS: Priom, Methew, Emran, Ali.

All of us purchase a huge variety of items from retail outlets: clothing, gifts, and of course, food. With every grocery cart filled with fresh vegetables, cereal, and cans of soup, comes an incredible array of point of sale, services, supply chain, and customer data.
Sobeys - Helping Canadians Eat Better, Feel Better, Do Better - has compiled a huge, anonymized retail data set that participants will use for this analytics focused hackathon.
During the kick-off on October 2, teams will be introduced to retail challenges and data use-cases from Sobeys. Participants will then learn about analytics and marketing techniques that will help them delve into the data.
Experts from IBM will provide access to IBM Bluemix, a next generation innovation platform, and provide tutorials on how to use Bluemix to create apps for the competition. Participants will also be introduced to IBM Watson, which can help teams find insights where no one ever thought to look before, using advanced analytics.

We provide the data, software and training - you generate the ideas.
